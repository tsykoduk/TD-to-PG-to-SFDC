			Welcome to the Treasure Data -&gt; SFDC demo
		</h1>
		<p>Currently we have <%= @td_count %> records in our staging table and <%= @sfdc_count %> in our SFDC Sync table</p>
		<p>Do you want to <a href="/pull-from-td">load data from Treasure Data into the Staging Table</a>?</p>
		<p>Do you want to <a href="/put-into-sfdc">load data from the Staging Table in to the Heroku Connect table</a>?</p>
		<p>After you are done, you can <a href="/clean-staging">Clean up the staging table</a> and <a href="/clean-sfdc">Clean up the Heroku Connect table (and SFDC as well. Just keep in mind that you will need to empty your recycle bin as well!)</a></p>
